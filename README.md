# Practice TDD

[This exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice) is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) and its purpose is to help practice TDD (Test Driven Development) but I also got a chance to practice my problem-solving skills by thinking through solutions of how to make a ceasar cipher and other things.

## Things that I learned

- How to use Jest with Babel
- How to write tests in Jest and make use of Matchers.
